### â˜• Java Programming

> Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence, reliability, and wide usage in software development.  

> It follows the principle of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), meaning compiled Java code can run on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  

> Java code is written in `.java` files, which are compiled by the Java compiler into bytecode (`.class` files). This bytecode is then executed by the JVM on the target machine.  

> Java supports concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation, making it ideal for building scalable and maintainable applications.  

> It is widely used in developing desktop applications, Android apps, web servers, enterprise software, and large-scale distributed systems.
